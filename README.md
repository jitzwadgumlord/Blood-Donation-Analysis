<h1>Blood Donation Prediction</h1>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>

<p>Welcome to the Blood Donation Prediction project! This repository leverages the power of three predictive algorithms to determine if a particular individual has donated blood on a given date. The models used are:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Logistic Regression</strong></li>
    <li><strong>XGBoost</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Neural Network</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>All models are implemented using the SciKit-Learn library.</p>

<p><strong>Algorithms</strong></p>

<p><strong>Logistic Regression</strong><br>
A statistical model that in its basic form uses a logistic function to model a binary dependent variable.</p>

<p><strong>XGBoost</strong><br>
An optimized gradient boosting framework that uses decision trees designed for speed and performance.</p>

<p><strong>Neural Network</strong><br>
A computational model inspired by the way biological neural networks in the human brain process information.</p>
